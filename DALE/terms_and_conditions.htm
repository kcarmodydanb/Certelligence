    <p>Please carefully read these terms and conditions (the “<strong>Product Agreement</strong>”), the DALE Foundation Terms of Use (“<span><a href="/Terms-of-Use">Terms of Use</a></span>”) and the DALE Foundation Privacy Policy (the “<span><a href="/Privacy-Policy">Privacy Policy</a></span>”)
      (collectively, the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) before you purchase the right to use the products in your shopping cart (the “<strong>Products</strong>”), as completion of your purchase constitutes your acceptance of the Agreement. If there is
      a conflict between the Terms of Use and the applicable Product Agreement, the terms of the Product Agreement apply to your use of the applicable Product. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, then you may not purchase, access or use
      any Product. Your purchase constitutes your acknowledgement that you have the legal authority to bind yourself to the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that you have read and are hereby bound by this Agreement and agree to comply
      with all applicable laws, regulations and/or rules with regard to your use of the Products.</p>
    <p>“<strong>Purchaser</strong>” means you, the Products’ purchaser. The DALE Foundation and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that Purchaser may make the Products available for use by individual learners (each a “<strong>Learner</strong>”); <em>provided that,</em>      each Learner agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Purchaser hereby agrees to the following:</p>
    <p>PURCHASER UNDERSTANDS THAT THE INFORMATION, TEXT, PHOTOS, DIAGRAMS AND OTHER MATERIALS CONTAINED IN THE PRODUCTS (INCLUDING CONTENT PROVIDED BY THE DALE FOUNDATION’S AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS) (COLLECTIVELY, THE “<strong>PRODUCT CONTENT</strong>”)
      IS PROVIDED ONLY AS AN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE. THE DALE FOUNDATION DOES NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR USEFULNESS OF THE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT CONTENT. PRODUCT CONTENT MAY BE OUT OF DATE AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND THE DALE FOUNDATION IS UNDER
      NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE IT. THE PRODUCT CONTENT IS NOT INTENDED AS, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS, LEGAL ADVICE. ADHERENCE TO ANY INFORMATION OR SUGGESTIONS CONTAINED IN THE PRODUCT CONTENT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND DOES NOT ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH
      ANY FEDERAL OR STATE LAWS, RULES OR REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY APPLY TO YOU. THE DALE FOUNDATION RECOMMENDS THAT YOU SEEK THE ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL REGARDING SUCH LAWS, RULES AND REQUIREMENTS.</p>
    <p>Purchaser understands that the DALE Foundation, its affiliates and licensors are the sole and exclusive owners of all right, title and interest in and to the Products and all Product Content, including all intellectual property rights, and that, except
      as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all rights relating to the Products and Product Content are expressly reserved by the DALE Foundation, its affiliates and licensors.</p>
    <p>In consideration for Purchaser’s payment of the applicable fee for a Product and subject to Learner’s compliance with this Agreement, Purchaser understands and agrees that the DALE Foundation is granting Learner a non-exclusive, limited license to
      use that Product solely for Learner’s personal, non-commercial use. Purchaser will not copy any Product Content or provide any Product Content to other individuals or organizations, nor will Purchaser use the Products or any Product Content to create
      his/her own review product or for any other purpose whatsoever. Purchaser further agrees not to provide his/her login and password to anyone. Purchaser understands that the DALE Foundation will strictly enforce its proprietary rights in the Products
      and Product Content and that Purchaser may face legal action if Purchaser breaks any term or condition of this Agreement, in addition to suspension or termination of Purchaser’s access to the Products. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that
      the DALE Foundation may suspend or terminate access to the Products at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
    <p>Purchaser understands that, with respect to Products that are continuing education courses, the DALE Foundation will award Learner the continuing education credits specified in the course description upon successful completion of the post-course assessment.
      Purchaser understands that Learner is responsible for printing the verification of participation, and that only Learner’s name, as the DALE Foundation registered user, will be printed on the verification of participation. Purchaser understands there
      are no certificates or continuing education credits associated with the DALE Foundation’s Products that are practice tests and study aids, such as the Glossary of Dental Terms.</p>
    <p>Purchaser understands that the fees for use of the Products are nonrefundable, and payment of the fees provides Learner with online access to each Product solely for the duration of the access period stated in the applicable Product description, starting
      with the date that Purchaser’s payment for that Product is processed by the DALE Foundation (the “<strong>Access Period</strong>”). Purchaser acknowledges that it can take the DALE Foundation up to one (1) business day to process payment and email
      course login information. <br><br>Purchaser may purchase Product license extensions in order to extend the Access Period for a Product; <em>provided, however,</em> that Learner may receive credit for completing a course only once. If Learner has
      already completed a course, the original date of completion will be retained and will be displayed on the verification of participation whether or not the Access Period is extended. For a course that Learner has not completed, or for study aids,
      purchase of a license extension will extend the time Learner has to complete the course. <br><br>PURCHASER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT EACH PRODUCT, INCLUDING ALL PRODUCT CONTENT, IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
      BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DALE FOUNDATION, ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
      AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. PURCHASER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT THE DALE FOUNDATION, ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR TIMELINESS OF INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE PRODUCTS AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY PRODUCT
      WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF PURCHASER, THAT ACCESS TO THE PRODUCTS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN ANY PRODUCT WILL BE CORRECTED. IN NO EVENT WILL THE DALE FOUNDATION, ITS AFFILATES OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DECISION
      MADE IN RELIANCE ON ANY PRODUCT CONTENT.
    </p>
    <p>THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE DALE FOUNDATION, ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND USE OF A PRODUCT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FEES PURCHASER PAID FOR THE PRODUCT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. IN NO EVENT WILL THE DALE FOUNDATION,
      ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO PURCHASER, LEARNER OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR OTHER DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF USE, LOSS
      OF BUSINESS, ECONOMIC LOSS, LOSS OF DATA, OR LOSS OF PROFITS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE OR USE OF ANY PRODUCT OR PRODUCT CONTENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION (INCLUDING CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTIONS),
      EVEN IF IT OR THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p>PURCHASER UNDERSTANDS THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OR THE DISCLAIMER OF SOME TYPES OF DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO PURCHASER OR LEARNER. IN SUCH EVENT, THE
      DALE FOUNDATION’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO PURCHASER, LEARNER AND ANY OTHER PARTIES WILL BE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
    <p>Purchaser and Learner have read and understand the system requirements described in the Course FAQs at <span><a href="/Courses-And-Study-Aids/Course-FAQs">www.dalefoundation.org/Courses-And-Study-Aids/Course-FAQs</a></span>&nbsp;and are solely responsible
      for obtaining all services and equipment necessary to access and use the Products and paying all usage and other charges associated therewith, including but not limited to telecommunications charges. Some of the foregoing services and equipment
      Purchaser obtains may be subject to terms that are different from or additional to the terms of this Agreement. Purchaser may be required to agree to such terms prior to use of such services and equipment.<br><br>Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
      that the Products may be delivered by email. Accordingly, Purchaser hereby consents to being contacted via email by the DALE Foundation regarding the Products or other DALE Foundation products in accordance with the <span><a href="/Privacy-Policy">Privacy Policy</a></span>.
      Purchaser hereby grants permission to the DALE Foundation to share Purchaser’s account information, including but not limited to name, email address and course information, with its affiliates and third parties in accordance with the <span><a href="/Privacy-Policy">Privacy Policy</a></span>.
      If Purchaser is purchasing the Products for someone other than him/herself, Purchaser certifies that he/she has permission to provide Learner’s name and email address to the DALE Foundation.</p>
    <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Purchaser and the DALE Foundation governing Purchaser’s and Learner’s use of the Products. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions
      of this Agreement will be unimpaired and will remain in full force and effect, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision will be replaced by a valid, legal and enforceable provision that comes closest to the parties’ intent underlying
      the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision. The DALE Foundation’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
    <p>Purchaser agrees that the statutes and laws of the United States and the State of Illinois, without regard to conflicts of laws principles, will apply to all matters relating to Purchaser’s purchase of and Purchaser use of the Products and any litigation
      will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts in Cook County, IL. Purchaser hereby consents and submits to personal jurisdiction of such courts and to extra-territorial service of process. Purchaser agrees that, regardless
      of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Products or this Agreement must be filed by Purchaser within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
      Purchaser further agrees that any disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with any Product and/or this Agreement will be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action.</p>
    <p>For any questions, complaints or claims regarding this Agreement or any Product, or for more information, please contact the DALE Foundation by e-mail at web@dalefoundation.org. You may also contact us by telephone at 1-877-510-3253, or by post at

    <p>This Agreement constitutes a binding agreement between Purchaser and the DALE Foundation. This Agreement is effective until terminated by Purchaser or Learner or the DALE Foundation. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the rights of Purchaser and
      each Learner to whom Purchaser has granted access to a Product under this Agreement will terminate automatically without notice from the DALE Foundation if Purchaser or that Learner fails to comply with any term of this Agreement. Upon termination
      of this Agreement, Purchaser and Learner will cease all use of the Products and Product Content and destroy all copies thereof. This Agreement is provided in English and the English version thereof will be valid, enforceable and binding.</p>

    <p>PURCHASER UNDERSTANDS THAT REVIEW COURSES ARE NOT EQUIVALENT TO DANB EXAMS, THAT COMPLETING A REVIEW COURSE IS NOT THE SAME AS OR A SUBSTITUTE FOR PASSING A DANB EXAM, AND THAT DANB DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT ANY DALE FOUNDATION REVIEW COURSES BE COMPLETED
